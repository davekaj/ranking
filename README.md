# Open Ranking Algorithm
Open Ranking Algorithm creates "rankings" or "scores" for Ethereum accounts based on past transaction history.
It leverages Subgraphs a lot, but there will be "stitching" together of data from Subgraphs, and other
data sources, in order to create useful rankings.
# How to Score the rankings
There are a few basic ways in which we will score accounts. With many more added in the future.
For now they are:

- General usage of the normal protocol (tracking the events or transactions at a high level)
- Claiming an Airdrop
- Liquidity mining
- The time the transaction was done
- The time it was done, relative to the age of the protocol
- Unique users on the protocol, or, unique addresses the address has interacted with. Or both
# Protocols evaluated
The starting protocols will be DeFi protocols. They have a lot of data, and a lot of usage. What
can be recreated today, is somewhat like a "Credit Score". But in reality, the potential of web3
means that we can create much more complex web3 scores that allow people to make decisions based
on cryptocurrency wallets past transactions.

We are focusing on some protocols that are well known, and have great communities:

1. AAVE (and LEND)
2. Compound
3. Uniswap
4. Maker

We may also check out some NFTs, like Bored Apes or Crypto Punks, and figure out a way to attribute
a score to that.
