# Thoughts

**Time**
- this will be heavily time-weighted. maybe it is worth while for us to standardize timing and weighting
- what i am thinking right now is timing rewards with decay:
  - been in it since init
  - holding, with decay
  - 1 day, 3 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year - timing frames, where you can attach points to. 
    - this can be decaying, or also just , after something is a month old, it is not included in the score. 

**Optimistic Scoring**
- With time based rankings, we will see that scores will get outdated, but will not be updated by the indexing until an event happens
- thus, we might need to actually always resolve in the front end. it is just a similar problem to what compound faces. **query time computation. i do not believe it is on the roadmap**

**Bonuses**
- Standard bonuses, 10%, double, combination bonuses. that can be shared between different scoring metrics
